## Inspiration  
Landing a job is tough—interviews are high-pressure, and you often only get one shot. We wanted to create a space where people can practice, fail safely, and get better before the real thing. That’s how **MockChain** was born: an AI-powered mock interview platform that helps you prep with confidence.

## What it does  
MockChain uses a team of AI agents to simulate realistic interviews tailored to your resume and the job description. It asks smart questions, gives detailed feedback on your answers *and* how you deliver them, and helps you improve every step of the way. All in a judgment-free, practice-friendly zone.

## How we built it  
We built a multi-agent system where each AI has a specific role: parsing resumes, analyzing job descriptions, generating interview questions, running mock interviews, and giving feedback. We also added a critique agent to polish everything before it reaches the user.

## Challenges we ran into  
- Making the agents work together smoothly  
- Balancing personalization with quality  
- Giving feedback that’s helpful, not robotic  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Simulated full mock interviews with detailed feedback  
- Made the system transparent so users can trust the process  
- Built a platform that’s actually fun and encouraging to use  

## What we learned  
- Multi-agent systems are powerful when everyone has a clear job  
- Users love transparency and thoughtful feedback  
- Practicing interviews doesn’t have to be stressful—it can be empowering

## What's next for MockChain  
- Voice/video interview mode  
- Company-specific prep  
- Progress tracking and gamification  
- Peer review and community features
